There are plenty of businesses occupying real estate in the digital realm, be it in search engine results or through social media campaigns. But for your small business with a small budget, competing with bigger businesses with bigger budgets and potentially entire, dedicated marketing teams, is all-but impossible.\nHere are our tips for beating the odds and crafting a digital marketing strategy that can boost your small business\u0026rsquo; reach in the online marketplace:\nTo carry out a successful, integrated, digital marketing strategy, small businesses need to build fast, intuitive, responsive websites, build mailing lists and devise an email marketing plan, create compelling content that appeals to potential customers, and remain active on social media. Creating profiles on online business databases such as Google My Business or Yelp can also help customers find you.\nSuccessful small businesses in every industry, whether run as e-commerce platforms or as traditional brick-and-mortar stores, will attest to the fact that digital marketing plays a fundamental role in the promotion of their brand and remaining competitive. But your business isn\u0026rsquo;t digital marketing. So there you have to learn the ins-and-outs of an entire industry or you have to spend money you have on specialised services. The good news, however, is that you\u0026rsquo;re reading this blog post and I can share some of the \u0026ldquo;hacks\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from more than a decade in the digital marketing industry.\nBuild a fast website for your small business Believe it or not, there are countless businesses out there that still don\u0026rsquo;t have their own websites. Some have been running for years operating just through a Facebook page and a WhatsApp number. For some small businesses that have a loyal customer base and that aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in expanding, this might work. But if you want more customers, a website is absolutely essential. It is the place that you want people to visit not only to buy your products and/or services, but to familiarise themselves with, and, eventually become loyal to your brand.\nYour website is a place for your customers to visit to get more information about your company, learn about your products and/or services, find out where to contact you (and where to find you on social media), and other important information.\nYour website also needs to be equipped with an online store. Most web content management systems like WordPress, Wix and Squarespace have integrated plugins for e-commerce and other dedicated e-commerce platforms like Shopify offer user-friendly templates and features.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s of particular importance is that you build a website that\u0026rsquo;s fast and responsive in this respect. Many users make their online purchases through mobile phones and tablets, meaning that it\u0026rsquo;s essential for your webpage to be just as user-friendly when scaled down for smaller screens. It also means that your webpage must load quickly. Too many widgets, images, videos and other page elements can increase your page loading time which can drive away customers. For example, if your page loading time increases from one to three seconds, bounce rates (customers leaving your webpage) increase by 32%; if it increases to 10 seconds, that bounce rate increases to 123%.\nBut if you really want to go the extra mile and maintain a website, keep it up to date and increase traffic, a blog is essential to truly capture the attention of your audience and convert them into customers. Your blog allows you to frequently update your website, giving your audience reason to keep coming back every day and build that oh-so-valuable brand loyalty.\nFor example, if you run a vintage clothing/thrift store and every 2-3 days you publish blog posts on topics like \u0026ldquo;Vintage Fashion Trends That Are Making a Comeback\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Best thrift stores in Cape Town\u0026rdquo;, you give your customers a reason to keep coming back – even if it\u0026rsquo;s not to buy something every time they do. It gives them a reason to follow your social media accounts. And most importantly, it establishes you as an authoritative voice in the digital ecosystem.\nSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO) Th reason you\u0026rsquo;ve built your entire website in the first place is so that you can increase your brand\u0026rsquo;s visibility. To do so in the digital marketplace, you need your website, your products, or your content to appear at the top of the search results when a potential customer searches for a relevant keyword, creating the first contact between them and your brand.\nBy climbing the rankings in search engines (search engine optimisation), you can increase organic traffic to your website and build trust with new customers. The goal of SEO, therefore, is to make Google and other search engines recognise the relevance and value of your brand and products to serve users when they search specific keywords. In this sense, SEO is one of the most fundamental features of any small business\u0026rsquo; digital marketing strategy.\nSEO is an entire discipline of digital marketing but the most important thing for you to recognise at this stage is that SEO is all about competition. Firstly, domain authority (DA) helps you climb the rankings in key phrase searches. This means that your webpage has high volumes of traffic and has established itself as a trustworthy source of information for themes related to the keywords. Establishing a high domain authority requires years of marketing however and depends on a number of factors that are simply out of reach for small businesses with limited budgets. Therefore, to counteract the high levels of competition for keywords, a small business needs to be targeting more niche searches and to create content specifically tailored towards less competitive keywords.\nContent marketing Content marketing takes your SEO strategy to the next level and helps you to build a brand identity, curate a personality for your audiences and establish yourself as an authoritative, credible industry leader. Small businesses should make their blogs the focal point of the content marketing strategy. Everything from tips to DIY guides to listicles and even personal stories can help you brand establish itself as an authority in your industry. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve attracted an audience and they\u0026rsquo;re engaging with your content, they keep coming back to your website for more reliable, honest, and relevant information. In principle, content marketing is distinct from regular, impressions-based advertising in that, rather than have 10,000 people visit your website once, your strategy should be to have 500 people visit your website 20 times. For small business owners, there are many platforms like Fiverr and Upwork where you can hire freelance content creators to create curated content for your blog.\nSocial media marketing Many people view social media, simply, as a way to amplify your brand, but the fact is that social media is also a discipline all on its own, with various, complicated mechanisms that need to be fulfilled – constantly. For the most part, your content marketing can guide your social media marketing and you can use your accounts to send users to your website\u0026rsquo;s blog. This keeps you active and relevant, without simply throwing adverts in your followers\u0026rsquo; faces every time you show up in their feeds. Product marketing is not necessarily a no-no, but it should be infrequent.\nRather, you want to build a digital personality for your brand. Your loyal customers already know what products and services you have to offer and don\u0026rsquo;t want to see a constant wave of regurgitated content on your product\u0026rsquo;s features. You should be sharing relevant, interesting and useful information. Think of yourself as your customer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;friend\u0026rsquo;. Your friends aren\u0026rsquo;t logging onto Facebook or Instagram to tell you about their vital information, like their height, education, or to tell you why you should be their friend.\nThey simply keep you updated about interesting developments in their lives or share something interesting they\u0026rsquo;ve come across on the internet – they aren\u0026rsquo;t there to sell themselves, and neither are you. You\u0026rsquo;re there to personify your brand, tell a story, share interesting information and keep your followers up to date. And if they take an interest in your journey after it\u0026rsquo;s already begun, you should be able to funnel them back to your website with calls to action. But your social media platforms are storytelling tools and must be treated as such.\nAnd this also means building a relationship with your customers like you would your friends. Responding to comments and messages or queries is a great way to ensure that your customer feels heard and like you\u0026rsquo;re responsive to their needs. For small businesses, automated software can help you fulfil this function without hiring a dedicated team.\nEmail marketing While technologically, email is a dinosaur in terms of modern forms of communication and has existed for half a century. However, emails form the bedrock of every internet user\u0026rsquo;s experience. It\u0026rsquo;s the repository that gives them access to everything they do online.\nIt should, therefore, come as no surprise that email marketing remains one of the most successful marketing channels for businesses, given its prominence and ubiquity in our digital lives. And, by creating informative, engaging, informative content that is distributed through planned strategies involving action-based, and time-based triggers, you can craft a relationship with your customers by remaining in close, consistent contact.\nFor small businesses, email marketing is the easiest and fastest way to entrench your relationship with your customers, because email marketing is a strategy that is entirely automated. With tools like Mailchimp, you can plan flows to customers, based on their interactions that will automatically nurture their journey towards brand recognition and brand loyalty.\nNot only this, but email marketing also allows you to understand your audience better by gathering data and analytics that can determine how many people opened the mail, clicked on the links, read articles, bought products, etc.\nPay-per-click (PPC) advertising There are plenty of ways to simply spend money on digital marketing and let the algorithms just do everything for you. Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is one of the main methods used in digital marketing strategies. You can promote your brand through targeted ads sent directly to users searching for relevant keywords or browsing on specific websites. You can target users through search engines with Google Ads, or you could target very specific demographics with more robust social media platforms like Facebook Ads and LinkedIn Ads.\nBut, while PPC is an effective way to drive immediate traffic, generate leads and increase conversions, it requires compelling ad copy and it needs to be closely monitored, with budgets being adjusted to maximise your ROI.\nWith both social media and search engine PPC advertising, you can boost your online presence very effectively and using smart, effective strategies allows you to do so without spending a fortune.\nMultimedia marketing Presenting your marketing content through different storytelling techniques is the difference between a good campaign and a great campaign. Blog posts should be just one medium used for your content marketing strategy. Video, graphics, audio, and even emerging technologies like VR/AR can and should form part of your brand\u0026rsquo;s storytelling/digital marketing techniques.\nVideos provide a dynamic, engaging way to connect with your audiences and potential customers. They can also be used to showcase product features and present various aspects of your brand and other content that your audience would find valuable. Presenting your blog content on social media with platform-optimised designs can also improve audience engagement while podcasts provide an avenue to explore the topics of the day at length with industry experts.\nAnd thanks to various video and design software that\u0026rsquo;s intuitive, affordable, such as Canva, Animoto, and even AI-powered editing software like Adobe Premier Pro and Final Cut Pro, it\u0026rsquo;s possible for small business owners with little or no experience to create compelling, attention-grabbing multimedia content in minutes.\nEstablishing interoperability in the content cycle, running from your website to your various social media platforms to your paid ads to your email marketing is fundamental to reaching the biggest audience possible for each piece of content you publish.\nLocal searches (Google Maps/Yelp) One great channel for your brand, if you have a physical location is to use user-generated content from platforms like Google My Business (for Google Maps), Yelp for Business and other local search directories. Claim your business on Google, fill in your business\u0026rsquo; contact details, website, operating hours and other vital information. But your focus here should not be on your own profile. Rather it should be on user-generated content. The beauty here is that you don\u0026rsquo;t actually do the work yourself; your customers do. What you need to do is notice your customers to post ratings, opinions and photos. On Google, if the photo is posted on Maps, it\u0026rsquo;s included in your businesses\u0026rsquo; profile. If your business is tagged on their Instagram posts, it is linked to your profile. A positive review from a customer is significantly more valuable than any ad you put out there. It\u0026rsquo;s a testimonial to the quality of your products and services.\nAnd, as your profile gathers more and more reviews and user generated content, it builds a bigger online presence and you can begin to compete with other local businesses for customers searching for specific keywords.\nSmall businesses can offer their customers a freebie in exchange for a review on Yelp or Google Maps. The increase in traffic will repay the cost of free goods or services several times over.\nInfluencer marketing The final channel for digital marketing that you can use is influencer marketing. By partnering with people who have a large online following and far-reaching influence in your industry or niche, you can collaborate on sponsored posts, guest blogs/appearances, product reviews and other marketing efforts. If your target markets falls within an influencer\u0026rsquo;s audience, your brand\u0026rsquo;s association with their content can kickstart the process of building brand loyalty.\nIdentifying relevant influencers whose audiences overlap with your target market however is tricky and they can also be difficult to reach. Working with an influencer to create resonating content that naturally integrates your brand can be one of the most effective digital marketing strategies if you get really creative.\nConclusion Creating and running an effective digital marketing strategy is not easy. And small business owners may have an especially hard time with amplifying exposure to their products and services due to budget and time limitations, among other challenges. But, by following our digital marketing tips for small businesses, you can grow your business and reach new customers from those across the street to those on the other side of the world.\nBut digital marketing is a time consuming exercise that requires time and money.

But for those of us in the industry who\u0026rsquo;s jobs are going to be radically transformed at the very least don\u0026rsquo;t need to despair, AI can be an incredibly useful tool for digital marketing and this is an opportunity for you to thrive if you keep up to date with the latest market trends!\nAI is transforming the digital marketing landscape with automated insights, predictive analytics, lead scoring, ad optimisation, and sentiment analysis. These new tools will help companies understand their customers better, but find better ways to target them and generate more conversions.\nDigital marketing is the process of promoting a brand or product online. It can be done through a variety of online channels, including search engines, social media, email, and websites.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that is changing the landscape of digital marketing. Here are five ways that AI is being used in digital marketing:\n1. Automated Insights One way AI is being used in digital marketing is to automate the process of generating insights. Insights are important for understanding what is working and what is not working with a digital marketing campaign.\nIn the past, these insights were generated manually by analysts who would pour over data and try to find trends. This is a time-consuming process that is subject to human error.\nWith AI, analysts can set up algorithms that will automatically generate insights. This means that digital marketers can get insights in real-time, which can be used to adjust campaigns on the fly.\n2. Predictive Analytics Another use for AI in digital marketing is predictive analytics. This is a type of AI that is used to understand what is going to happen in the future.\nThis is done by analysing past data and trends. Based on this data, predictive analytics can provide insights into what is going to happen in the future.\nThis type of AI is being used by digital marketers to understand how customers will react to different marketing campaigns. By understanding this, marketers can adjust their campaigns to maximise results.\n3. Lead Scoring Lead scoring is a process that is used to identify the best leads for a sales team. In the past, this was a manual process that was time-consuming and subject to human error.\nWith AI, lead scoring can be automated. This means that the best leads can be identified in real-time, which can save a lot of time for sales teams.\n4. Ad Optimisation Ad optimisation is another area where AI is being used in digital marketing. In the past, ads were manually placed on websites and in other online channels.\nThis was a hit-or-miss process that was not very effective. With AI, ads can be automatically placed in the most effective locations.\nThis means that ads are more likely to be seen by people who are interested in them. As a result, businesses can save money on advertising, and they can get better results from their campaigns.\n5. Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis is a process that is used to understand the emotions of people. This is done by analysing the language that people use.\nWith sentiment analysis, digital marketers can understand how people feel about a brand or product. This type of AI is being used to understand the customer’s journey.\nBy understanding the emotions of customers, digital marketers can provide a better experience for them. This, in turn, can lead to more sales and more loyal customers.\nSounds crazy, right? The future of digital marketing is here, and in a few year, the industry may look completely unrecognisable. The sky is the limit when it comes to the potential that AI holds for the digital marketing industry.\nAnd if you want to stay up to date with the latest market trends, the Essential Millennial is here to keep you in the loop!\nSubscribe to our newsletter HERE to get our latest stories sent directly into your inbox as soon as they\u0026rsquo;re published.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/digital-marketing-for-tiktok/","title":"EM Tutorials: Digital Marketing For TikTok","description":"In this article we introduce you to TikTok and provide simple digital marketing strategies for you to use.","date":"January 1, 1","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/tiktok-phone-black_hu139282defde02d52561222b5452167dd_330961_420x0_resize_q90_h2_lanczos.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/tiktok-phone-black_hu139282defde02d52561222b5452167dd_330961_420x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/tiktok-phone-black_hu139282defde02d52561222b5452167dd_330961_100x100_fill_q90_h2_lanczos_smart1.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/tiktok-phone-black_hu139282defde02d52561222b5452167dd_330961_100x100_fill_q90_lanczos_smart1.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Social Media, Digital Marketing","tags":"social media, digital marketing, tiktok","content":"TikTok has emerged as the leading social media platform for brands to reach large audiences, particularly those targeting younger demographics.

But what you may not realise is that video is one of the most effective types of content you can share on social media. In fact, 78% of people say they’ve watched an entire video on Facebook in the last week.\nTo create eye-catching videos that keep your audiences engaged and generate more leads and conversions, make sure your videos start with a strong hook, use closed captions, thumbnails, relevant tags and that they aren\u0026rsquo;t too long.\nSo, how can you create eye-catching videos that will capture attention and get results? Here are 7 tips:\n1. Keep it short and sweet The attention span of most viewers is very short, so it’s important to make your videos as concise as possible. Aim for videos that are 60 seconds or less.\n2. Start with a strong hook You only have a few seconds to capture someone’s attention, so make sure your video starts strong. Use an attention-grabbing image or video clip, and make sure your first few seconds are engaging and exciting.\n3. Use descriptive captions Captions are important for two reasons: They help viewers understand your video if they can’t hear the audio, and they help search engines index your video so people can find it. Use descriptive captions that accurately describe what’s happening in your video.\n4. Use relevant tags Tags are another way to help people find your video. When you upload your video to a social media platform like YouTube, be sure to include relevant tags so people can easily discover your content.\n5. Optimise your title and thumbnail Your title and thumbnail are the first things people will see when they come across your video, so make sure they’re catchy and inviting. Use attractive visuals and descriptive text to give viewers a taste of what your video is about.\n6. Promote your video Once you’ve created your video, it’s important to promote it to ensure as many people as possible see it. Share it on your social media channels, embed it on your website, and send it to your email list.\n7. Analyse your results After you’ve promoted your video, take some time to analyse the results. How many people watched it? How long did they watch it? Where did they come from? Which call to action led to the most conversions? Learning from your past videos will help you create even more successful ones in the future.\nBy following these tips, you can create eye-catching videos that people will want to watch and that will help you achieve your business goals.\n"}]
